## A Quick Introduction

**Jottings** was created to solve the complexities of project management in a non-complex way.
Our overall vision will require many more features so expect weekly updates and bug fixes. I appreciate you being here and trying out the application!

## Some of our priorities moving forward

1.  Your data is safe, protected, and only viewable to YOU!
2.  User experience is top priority in every feature and design tweak that occurs.
3.  All features will be backward compatible unless expressed otherwise within the changelog.
4.  Building in public to give back to the community on how to build advanced web applications.
